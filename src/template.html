      <h2>Welcome to Thirsty's</h2>
      <p>Bored of basic? So are we. At Thirsty's, we mix magic by the glass — bold blends, wild colors, and flavours you didn't know you were craving. Foke, Spritsey, Rainbow Rush… they're not just drinks, they're an experience. Retro vibes, fizzy feels, and a menu full of “wait, what is THAT?!” Come thirsty, leave grinning.</p>
